Simple website with two pages made for school project so it's nothig special. First one is for posts and second one is for news. Website also contains login/register sistem but it's not working perfictly so I created that user needs to login just to post a comment. Also, I created admin backend that opens when admin log in. On admin back end is menu that shows how many posts, news, users and comments are in database and it allows admin to edit them or just create a new post or news. For comment system user can write just comment, there is no reply system (yet, I hope i will make it some time) and admin can just see all comment posted for some post.
